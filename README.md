# Recent Articles Wordpress Plugin
***

Recent Articles is built as a wordpress widget allowing you to add a set number of recent articles
inside a post. The plugin can be enabled or disabled via the Admin Plugins page. When enabled, you can customize where the widget should appear via the Admin Appearance menu. Just drag and drop a Recent Articles Widget into a drop zone and begin configure the widget.

To install, download a copy of the zip file using the download button. Then add the plugin via the Admin Plugins page.

If you want to have the widget to appear immediately after a post, you need to modify the theme.
See https://github.com/kitkat729/wp-plugin-recent-articles/issues/6 for detail instructions.

Enjoy!
